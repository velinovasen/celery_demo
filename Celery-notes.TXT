1. 	If we call the function with .delay() at the end - we call it async, while without .delay() we
	call it sync (gonna wait for it to finish)

2.	To make a worker be working succesfully on windows 10 we have to start it with this command:
	celery -A proj_name worker -l info -P solo instead of just celery -A proj_name worker -l info
	This way also we run the worker with only 1 processor instead of full capacity.
	The way around is to use celery -A proj_name worker -l info -P gevent after we do
	pip install gevent. Tried with eventlet but did not work.

3. 	py manage.py inspectdb - gives a quick look at the database

4.	celery -A proj_name purge - deletes all tasks in the queue

5.	pip install flower -> for monitoring! it opens a server with celery -A proj_name flower and we
	can track it from there.
